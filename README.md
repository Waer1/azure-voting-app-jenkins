# Azure Voting App

This sample creates a multi-container application in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The application interface has been built using Python / Flask. The data component is using Redis.

To walk through a quick deployment of this application, see the AKS [quick start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough?WT.mc_id=none-github-nepeters).

To walk through a complete experience where this code is packaged into container images, uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and then run in and AKS cluster, see the [AKS tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app?WT.mc_id=none-github-nepeters).
